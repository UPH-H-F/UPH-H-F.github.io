                      Computing is now something that fascinates us in almost every aspect of our lives, and has a history that dates back long before we had smartphones and the internet. To understand how far we have come with our current technology, let us look back and see how it all started, as knowing the earlier stages of how things work can help anyone become more comfortable and accustomed to our technology driven world.
                  </p>

                      The story of computing is a long one, full of brilliant ideas and people who were ahead of their time. One of the earliest tools that was used by humans to help with computation is the abacus. An ancient device which looks like a simple rectangular flat box with beads was used to perform mathematical operations like addition and subtraction. It may look basic but the abacus was a huge leap for humans to efficiently manage numbers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      In the 20th century, we learned about the key figures that shaped the future of computing. Alan Turing is one of them. He is often referred to as "the father of modern computer science" and "a founder of artificial intelligence" because of his groundbreaking work during World War II. Turing had an idea of a machine, the Turing machine model, first described in 1936, is a simple mathematical model of computation that could follow instructions to solve any problem, which is now a groundwork for modern computers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      There's also Grace Hopper, a computer scientist who made using computers much easier by creating the world's first compiler in 1952. Hopper was also behind the creation of one of the earliest programming languages and the first universal computer language designed for business, COBOL, which is still the backbone for many critical systems. This language made it possible for computers to manage complicated business operations and her work opened the door to a lot of software that we now rely on.

                  <p>
                      These milestones show us how far we have come, from the simple tool for calculation to the powerful computers that we use every day. Without contributions from people like Turing and Hopper, our world of instant communication and endless information might not look like it does today.

                    Looking back at the history of computing helps us understand some key concepts in Information Technology (IT) which plays a big role in our everyday lives. IT involves the computer to manage information, include storing, processing or sharing data. Let’s break it down:
                </p>
            
                <p>
                <b>Hardware</b>
                <br>Hardware is the physical objects that you can see and touch like your computer, mobile phone, smartwatch, or tablet. The CPU or Central Processing Unit is its brain, it does all the thinking as it processes data. The RAM or Random Access Memory is temporary memory that helps the CPU to work faster by holding bits of information temporarily. Storage like the hard drive inside the computer is where everything is stored.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                <b>Software</b>
                <br>Software is what you can't physically see what its doing to the hardware but its tells your computer what to do. There are two main types: system software like Windows, Android, and Linux, that makes it possible for the computer to run. Without software, you can only sit in front of your computer while the screen is off.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                <b>Networking</b>
                <br>Networking is about computers communicating with each other. This includes your Wi-Fi at home and the entire internet. Networking helps us transfer information to and from any location as long as it's online. Think of it as the bridges that connects Philippines islands, ensuring there is a way to go to and retrieve data even if one is in Manila and the other is in Palawan.
                </p>
             
                <p>
                <b>IT in modern organizations</b>
                <br>Today, IT is a big deal for businesses. It helps them manage data, increase productivity, and improve communication. IT is not only about repairing computers, it is also about making sure everything is working fine, from helping customers to supporting remote jobs. It is an important part of helping a business stay competitive and operate more efficiently
